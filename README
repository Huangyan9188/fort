Fort is a Free Software password manager for GNU/Linux. 
It probably works on other free software operating systems 
too such as FreeBSD.

Fort allows you to store passwords and other sensitive information.
Today, it's important not to use the same password on multiple places.
Passwords should also be more than 8 characters long and contain mixed
case letters, numbers and special characters. Of course it's impossible
to remember such passwords. That's where Fort comes in. All you have
to do is to remember one password, the Fort master key.
Fort will remember rest of your passwords.

Fort is written in C++ using QT libraries. For encryption it uses 
Botan library. Data is encrypted using AES with 256bit keys. 
Fort master key is validated using bcrypt algorithm.
